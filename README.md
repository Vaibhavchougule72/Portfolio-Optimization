*Stock Portfolio Optimization*

### Introduction
This project focuses on optimizing stock portfolios using Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT). We use historical stock price data and various statistical techniques to construct diversified portfolios that maximize returns while minimizing risk.

### Key Features
- Data collection: Utilized Python libraries to fetch historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance API.
- Data preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed raw stock price data, handling missing values and adjusting for splits and dividends.
- Portfolio construction: Implemented mean-variance optimization to find the optimal allocation of assets in the portfolio.
- Visualization: Utilized matplotlib and seaborn to visualize the efficient frontier and individual stock returns.
- Performance evaluation: Evaluated portfolio performance using key metrics such as expected return and volatility.

### How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required Python packages using pip install -r requirements.txt.
3. Run the notebook Stock_Portfolio_Optimization.ipynb to see the step-by-step process of optimizing stock portfolios.
4. Customize the notebook with your own stock tickers and investment preferences.

### Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

### Future Enhancements
- Incorporate transaction costs and constraints into the optimization process.
- Implement machine learning techniques for predictive modeling of stock returns.
